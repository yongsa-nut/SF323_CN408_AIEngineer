However, fixed investment remained robust, accelerating to 5.8% from 4.7%. Exports also performed strongly, rising by 12.2%, outpacing imports which increased by 10.8%.

However, growth is projected to slow to 1.8% in 2025 due to various structural impediments, including high market concentration, limited foreign competition, wealth inequality, high private household debt (88.4% of GDP in 2024), and an aging population. The manufacturing sector, particularly automotive, contracted significantly (-20.7%).\\\\n\\\\nExports reached a record high of USD 300.5 billion (+5.4%) in 2024, but the outlook for 2025 is uncertain, with a potential 36% reciprocal tariff from the US posing a serious threat. Despite double-digit export growth in Q1 2025 (driven by accelerated shipments to the US and China ahead of tariffs), Moody's revised Thailand's outlook from 'stable' to 'negative' due to tariff uncertainties. The IMF also lowered Thailand's 2025 growth forecast to 1.8%. The tourism sector, while strong in 2024, saw a decline in Chinese arrivals in early 2025. Thai stocks fell 16% between January and May 2025, marking them among the world's worst-performing major indices. Private consumption growth slowed to 4.4% in 2024 and is projected at 2.4% in 2025. Inflation for 2024 averaged 0.4%, with a projection of 0.0% to 1.0% for 2025. The Bank of Thailand began monetary easing in October 2024, cutting the policy interest rate to 1.75% by May 2025.

This growth is supported by sustained private consumption, recovering tourism, and goods exports. The outlook for 2025 is even more optimistic, with a projected growth of 2.8%, driven by both domestic and external demand, and bolstered by the revised fiscal budget proposal for 2025.\\\\n\\\\nKey drivers for this growth include private consumption and tourism, although their pace is expected to slow. Goods exports are anticipated to rebound due to favorable global trade conditions, while tourism is projected to return to pre-pandemic levels by mid-2025, despite setbacks from the Chinese economy. Headline inflation is expected to be low at 0.7% in 2024, below the central bank's target, due to moderating food and energy prices.\\\\n\\\\nHowever, Thailand faces challenges in reconciling fiscal sustainability with short-term stimulus measures. Public debt is projected to increase to 64.6% in FY2025, and the fiscal deficit is expected to rise to 3.6% of GDP. To enhance fiscal resilience, the report suggests focusing on more targeted social assistance, increasing tax revenue, promoting equity, and accelerating investment.\\\\n\\\\nBeyond immediate economic forecasts, the report highlights the long-term potential of secondary cities in unlocking Thailand's productivity and economic growth. While Bangkok has historically been the primary economic engine, it shows signs of stagnation, with secondary cities exhibiting significantly faster per capita GDP growth. The report advocates for greater local authority over urban planning, infrastructure, and access to long-term financing mechanisms for these secondary cities to realize their full economic potential.\\\",\\n  \\\"key_excerpts\\\": \\\"Growth is projected to accelerate from 1.9 percent in 2023 to 2.4 percent in 2024.\\\", \\\"Growth is expected to reach 2.8 percent in 2025, supported by both domestic and external demand.\\\", \\\"Private consumption and tourism will be key drivers but their pace will slow.
