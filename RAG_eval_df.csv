Messenger RNA translation: Regulation of gene expression can also occur at the level of mRNA translation. One mechanism by which translation is regulated is through phosphorylation of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor, eIF-2 (Fig. 33.16). Phosphorylation of eIF-2 inhibits its function and so inhibits translation at the initiation step (see p. 459). [Note: Phosphorylation of eIF-2 prevents its reactivation by inhibiting GDP-GTP exchange.] Phosphorylation is catalyzed by kinases that are activated in response to environmental conditions, such as amino acid starvation, heme deficiency in erythroblasts, the presence of double-stranded RNA (signaling viral infection), and the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (see p. 460).

There they can be reconverted to acetyl CoA, which can be oxidized by the TCA cycle. Ketone bodies are important sources of energy for the peripheral tissues because they 1) are soluble in aqueous solution and, therefore, do not need to be incorporated into lipoproteins or carried by albumin as do the other lipids; 2) are produced in the liver during periods when the amount of acetyl CoA present exceeds the oxidative capacity of the liver; and 3) are used in proportion to their concentration in the blood by extrahepatic tissues, such as skeletal and cardiac muscle, the intestinal mucosa, and the renal cortex. Even the brain can use ketone bodies to help meet its energy needs if the blood levels rise sufficiently. Thus, ketone bodies spare glucose, which is particularly important during prolonged periods of fasting (see p. 332)"
3,"Which amino acids, upon hydrolysis of tissue proteins during a fast, can serve as major sources of glucose?",Amino acids produced by hydrolysis of tissue proteins are the major sources of glucose during a fast.,Amino acids produced by hydrolysis of tissue proteins are the major sources of glucose during a fast.,"C. Amino acids

Amino acids produced by hydrolysis of tissue proteins are the major sources of glucose during a fast. Their metabolism generates α-keto acids, such as pyruvate that is converted to glucose, or α-ketoglutarate that can enter the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and form oxaloacetate (OAA), a direct precursor of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP). [Note: Acetyl coenzyme A (CoA) and compounds that give rise only to acetyl CoA (for example, acetoacetate, lysine, and leucine) cannot give rise to a net synthesis of glucose. This is because of the irreversible nature of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHC), which converts pyruvate to acetyl CoA (see p. 109). These compounds give rise instead to ketone bodies (see p.

195) and are termed ketogenic.]

4,"What are the two primary products of the irreversible oxidative phase of the pentose phosphate pathway, besides carbon dioxide?",One pentose sugar-phosphate plus two reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphates (NADPH) are produced.,"In the oxidative phase, carbon 1 of a glucose 6-phosphate molecule is released as carbon dioxide (CO2), and one pentose sugar-phosphate plus two reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphates (NADPH) are produced.","I. OVERVIEW

The pentose phosphate pathway (or, hexose monophosphate shunt) occurs in the cytosol. It includes an irreversible oxidative phase, followed by a series of reversible sugar–phosphate interconversions (Fig. 13.1). In the oxidative phase, carbon 1 of a glucose 6-phosphate molecule is released as carbon dioxide (CO2), and one pentose sugar-phosphate plus two reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphates (NADPH) are produced. The rate and direction of the reversible reactions are determined by the supply of and demand for intermediates of the pathway. The pentose phosphate pathway provides a major portion of the body’s NADPH, which functions as a biochemical reductant. It also produces ribose 5-phosphate, required for nucleotide biosynthesis (see p. 293), and provides a mechanism for the conversion of pentose sugars to triose and hexose intermediates of glycolysis. No ATP is directly consumed or produced in the pathway.

6,"What are the two main products of the first step in heme degradation, catalyzed by microsomal heme oxygenase, besides Fe2+?",Biliverdin and carbon monoxide (CO).,"In the presence of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate and oxygen, the enzyme catalyzes three successive oxygenations that result in opening of the porphyrin ring (converting cyclic heme to linear biliverdin), production of carbon monoxide (CO), and release of Fe2+.","1. Bilirubin formation: The first step in the degradation of heme is catalyzed by microsomal heme oxygenase in macrophages of the MPS. In the presence of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate and oxygen, the enzyme catalyzes three successive oxygenations that result in opening of the porphyrin ring (converting cyclic heme to linear biliverdin), production of carbon monoxide (CO), and release of Fe2+ (see Fig. 21.9). [Note: The CO has biologic function, acting as a signaling molecule and anti-inflammatory. Iron is discussed in Chapter 29.] Biliverdin, a green pigment, is reduced, forming the red-orange bilirubin. Bilirubin and its derivatives are collectively termed bile pigments. [Note: The changing colors of a bruise reflect the varying pattern of intermediates that occurs during heme degradation.]"
7,What are the two primary ketone bodies synthesized and released by the liver?,3-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate,"The liver is unique in being able to synthesize and release ketone bodies, primarily 3-hydroxybutyrate but also acetoacetate, for use as fuel by peripheral tissues","2. Increased ketogenesis: The liver is unique in being able to synthesize and release ketone bodies, primarily 3-hydroxybutyrate but also acetoacetate, for use as fuel by peripheral tissues but not by the liver itself because liver lacks thiophorase (see p. 197). Ketogenesis, which starts during the first days of fasting (Fig. 24.13), is favored when the concentration of acetyl CoA from FA oxidation exceeds the oxidative capacity of the TCA cycle. [Note: Ketogenesis releases CoA, insuring its availability for continued FA oxidation.] The availability of circulating water-soluble ketone bodies is important in fasting because they can be used for fuel by most tissues, including the brain, once their blood level is high enough. Ketone body concentration in blood increases from ~50 µM to ~6 mM in fasting. This reduces the need for gluconeogenesis from amino acid carbon skeletons, thus preserving essential protein (see Fig. 24.11)"
8,What is the primary source of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA)?,Plant-based oils,Monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) are generally obtained from plant-based oils.,"2. Monounsaturated fats: TAG containing primarily fatty acids with one double bond are referred to as monounsaturated fats. Monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) are generally obtained from plant-based oils. When substituted for saturated fatty acids in the diet, MUFA lower both total plasma cholesterol and LDL-C and maintain or increase HDL-C. This ability of MUFA to favorably modify lipoprotein levels may explain, in part, the observation that Mediterranean cultures, with diets rich in olive oil (high in monounsaturated oleic acid), show a low incidence of CHD. [Note: Although there is no AMDR for MUFA, a common recommendation is 10%–20% of caloric intake.] a. The Mediterranean diet: The Mediterranean diet is an example of a diet rich in MUFA (from olive oil) and polyunsaturated fatty acids or PUFA (from fish oils, plant oils, and some nuts) but low in saturated fat.

9,What percentage of the world's adults are estimated to be lactose intolerant?,Over 60%,Over 60% of the world’s adults are lactose intolerant,"Lactose intolerance: Over 60% of the world’s adults are lactose intolerant (Fig. 7.11). This is particularly manifested in certain populations. For example, up to 90% of adults of African or Asian descent are lactase deficient. Consequently, they are less able to metabolize lactose than are individuals of Northern European origin. The age-dependent loss of lactase activity starting at approximately age 2 years represents a reduction in the amount of enzyme produced. It is thought to be caused by small variations in the DNA sequence of a region on chromosome 2 that controls expression of the gene for lactase, also on chromosome 2. Treatment for this disorder is to reduce consumption of milk; eat yogurts and some cheeses (bacterial action and aging process decrease lactose content) as well as green vegetables, such as broccoli, to ensure adequate calcium intake; use lactase-treated products; or take lactase in pill form prior to eating"
10,What are the two primary metabolic pathways the liver utilizes to maintain blood glucose levels in the fasted state?,Glycogen degradation and gluconeogenesis,The liver first uses glycogen degradation and then gluconeogenesis to maintain blood glucose levels to sustain energy metabolism of the brain and other glucose-requiring tissues in the fasted state.,"The liver first uses glycogen degradation and then gluconeogenesis to maintain blood glucose levels to sustain energy metabolism of the brain and other glucose-requiring tissues in the fasted state. [Note: Recall that the presence of glucose-6-phosphatase in the liver allows the production of free glucose both from glycogenolysis and from gluconeogenesis (see Fig. 24.4).] 1. Increased glycogenolysis: Figure 24.11 shows the sources of blood glucose after ingestion of 100 g of glucose. During the brief absorptive period, ingested glucose is the major source of blood glucose. Several hours later, blood glucose levels have declined sufficiently to cause increased secretion of glucagon and decreased secretion of insulin"

12,What are the three primary functions of calcitriol in maintaining adequate serum calcium levels?,"Calcitriol increases intestinal uptake of Ca2+, minimizes Ca2+ loss by the kidney through increased reabsorption, and stimulates bone resorption when blood Ca2+ is low.","C. Function
The overall function of calcitriol is to maintain adequate serum levels of Ca2+ . It performs this function by 1) increasing uptake of Ca2+ by the intestine, 2) minimizing loss of Ca2+ by the kidney by increasing reabsorption, and 3) stimulating resorption (demineralization) of bone when blood Ca2+ is low","Hydroxycholecalciferol 1-hydroxylase activity is increased directly by low serum PO43− or indirectly by low serum Ca2+ , which triggers the secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH) from the chief cells of the parathyroid gland. PTH upregulates the 1-hydroxylase. Thus, hypocalcemia caused by insufficient dietary Ca2+ results in elevated levels of serum 1,25-diOH-D3. [Note: 1,25-diOH-D3 inhibits expression of PTH, forming a negative feedback loop. It also inhibits activity of the 1-hydroxylase.]

[Note: These standard amino acids are the only amino acids that are encoded by DNA, the genetic material in the cell (see p. 411). Nonstandard amino acids are produced by chemical modification of standard amino acids (see p. 45).] Each amino acid has a carboxyl group, a primary amino group (except for proline, which has a secondary amino group), and a distinctive side chain (R group) bonded to the α carbon atom. At physiologic pH (~7.4), the carboxyl group is dissociated, forming the negatively charged carboxylate ion (−COO−), and the amino group is protonated (−NH3+) (Fig. 1.1A). In proteins, almost all of these carboxyl and amino groups are combined through peptide linkage and, in general, are not available for chemical reaction except for hydrogen bond formation (Fig. 1.1B)"

Constructing primer: It is not necessary to know the nucleotide sequence of the target DNA in the PCR method. However, it is necessary to know the nucleotide sequence of short segments on each side of the target DNA. These stretches, called flanking sequences, bracket the DNA sequence of interest. The nucleotide sequences of the flanking regions are used to construct two, single-stranded oligonucleotides, usually 20– 35 nucleotides long, which are complementary to the respective flanking sequences. The 3′-hydroxyl end of each oligonucleotide points toward the target sequence (see Fig. 34.20). These synthetic oligonucleotides function as primers in PCR.

Nucleoside di-and triphosphate synthesis

Nucleoside diphosphates are synthesized from the corresponding nucleoside monophosphates by base-specific nucleoside monophosphate kinases (Fig. 22.9). [Note: These kinases do not discriminate between ribose or deoxyribose in the substrate.] ATP is generally the source of the transferred phosphate because it is present in higher concentrations than the other nucleoside triphosphates. Adenylate kinase is particularly active in the liver and in muscle, where the turnover of energy from ATP is high. Its function is to maintain equilibrium among the adenine nucleotides (AMP, ADP, and ATP). Nucleoside diphosphates and triphosphates are interconverted by nucleoside diphosphate kinase, an enzyme that, unlike the monophosphate kinases, has broad substrate specificity.

An underlying theme occurs repeatedly: A trans-acting protein functions as a specific transcription factor (STF) that binds to a cisacting regulatory consensus sequence (see p. 415) on each of the genes in the group even if they are on different chromosomes. [Note: The STF has a DNA-binding domain (DBD) and a transcription activation domain (TAD). The TAD recruits coactivators, such as histone acetyltransferases (see p. 438), and the general transcription factors (see p. 439) that, along with RNA pol, are required for formation of the transcription initiation complex at the promoter.

[Note: Human DNA for cloning can be obtained from blood, saliva, and solid tissue.] In some cases, a single DNA fragment can be isolated and purified prior to cloning. More commonly, to clone a nucleotide sequence of interest, the total cellular DNA is first cleaved with a specific restriction enzyme, creating hundreds of thousands of fragments. Each of the resulting DNA fragments is joined to a DNA vector molecule (referred to as a cloning vector) to form a hybrid, or recombinant, DNA molecule. Each recombinant molecule carries its inserted DNA fragment into a single host cell (for example, a bacterium), where it is replicated.

Oxidation of fatty acids with an odd number of carbons proceeds two carbons at a time (producing acetyl CoA) until three-carbon propionyl CoA remains. This compound is carboxylated to methylmalonyl CoA (by biotin-and ATP-requiring propionyl CoA carboxylase), which is then converted to succinyl CoA (a gluconeogenic precursor) by vitamin B12-requiring methylmalonyl CoA mutase. A genetic error in the mutase or vitamin B12 deficiency causes methylmalonic acidemia and aciduria. β-Oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids requires additional enzymes. β-Oxidation of verylong-chain fatty acids and α-oxidation of branched-chain fatty acids occur in the peroxisome. Deficiencies result in X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy and Refsum disease, respectively. ω-Oxidation, normally a minor pathway, occurs in the SER.

I. OVERVIEW

Virtually all reactions in the body are mediated by enzymes, which are protein catalysts that increase the rate of reactions without being changed in the overall process. Among the many biologic reactions that are energetically possible, enzymes selectively channel reactants (called substrates) into useful pathways. Thus, enzymes direct all metabolic events. This chapter examines the nature of these catalytic molecules and their mechanisms of action.

26,What is the most prevalent metalloporphyrin in humans?,Heme,The most prevalent metalloporphyrin in humans is heme,"II. PORPHYRIN METABOLISM

Porphyrins are cyclic compounds that readily bind metal ions, usually ferrous (Fe2+) or ferric (Fe3+) iron. The most prevalent metalloporphyrin in humans is heme, which consists of one Fe2+ coordinated in the center of the tetrapyrrole ring of protoporphyrin IX (see p. 279). Heme is the prosthetic group for hemoglobin (Hb), myoglobin, the cytochromes, the cytochrome P450 (CYP) monooxygenase system, catalase, nitric oxide synthase, and peroxidase. These hemeproteins are rapidly synthesized and degraded. For example, 6–7 g of Hb is synthesized each day to replace heme lost through the normal turnover of erythrocytes. The synthesis and degradation of the associated porphyrins and recycling of the iron are coordinated with the turnover of hemeproteins.

Seven of the reactions of glycolysis are reversible and are used for gluconeogenesis in the liver and kidneys. Three reactions, catalyzed by pyruvate kinase, phosphofructokinase-1, and glucokinase/hexokinase, are physiologically irreversible and must be circumvented. Pyruvate is converted to oxaloacetate and then to phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) by pyruvate carboxylase (PC) and PEPcarboxykinase (PEPCK ).

The collagen superfamily of proteins includes >25 collagen types as well as additional proteins that have collagen-like domains. The three polypeptide α chains are held together by interchain hydrogen bonds. Variations in the amino acid sequence of the α chains result in structural components that are about the same size (~1,000 amino acids long) but with slightly different properties. These α chains are combined to form the various types of collagen found in the tissues. For example, the most common collagen, type I, contains two chains called α1 and one chain called α2 (α12α2), whereas type II collagen contains three α1 chains (α13). The collagens can be organized into three groups, based on their location and functions in the body (Fig. 4.2).
