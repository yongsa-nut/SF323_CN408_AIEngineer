0,What molecular modification of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF-2 inhibits its function and consequently downregulates translation at the initiation step?,Phosphorylation of eIF-2,Phosphorylation of eIF-2 inhibits its function and so inhibits translation at the initiation step,"5. Messenger RNA translation: Regulation of gene expression can also occur at the level of mRNA translation. One mechanism by which translation is regulated is through phosphorylation of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor, eIF-2 (Fig. 33.16). Phosphorylation of eIF-2 inhibits its function and so inhibits translation at the initiation step (see p. 459). [Note: Phosphorylation of eIF-2 prevents its reactivation by inhibiting GDP-GTP exchange.] Phosphorylation is catalyzed by kinases that are activated in response to environmental conditions, such as amino acid starvation, heme deficiency in erythroblasts, the presence of double-stranded RNA (signaling viral infection), and the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (see p. 460).

Thus, NO can be envisioned as an endogenous nitrovasodilator. [Note: Under hypoxic conditions, nitrite (NO2−) can be reduced to NO, which binds to deoxyhemoglobin. The NO is released into the blood, causing vasodilation and increasing blood flow.] 3."
2,What are the three reasons ketone bodies are important sources of energy for peripheral tissues?,"Ketone bodies are important sources of energy for the peripheral tissues because they 1) are soluble in aqueous solution and, therefore, do not need to be incorporated into lipoproteins or carried by albumin as do the other lipids; 2) are produced in the liver during periods when the amount of acetyl CoA present exceeds the oxidative capacity of the liver; and 3) are used in proportion to their concentration in the blood by extrahepatic tissues.","Ketone bodies are important sources of energy for the peripheral tissues because they 1) are soluble in aqueous solution and, therefore, do not need to be incorporated into lipoproteins or carried by albumin as do the other lipids; 2) are produced in the liver during periods when the amount of acetyl CoA present exceeds the oxidative capacity of the liver; and 3) are used in proportion to their concentration in the blood by extrahepatic tissues",". There they can be reconverted to acetyl CoA, which can be oxidized by the TCA cycle. Ketone bodies are important sources of energy for the peripheral tissues because they 1) are soluble in aqueous solution and, therefore, do not need to be incorporated into lipoproteins or carried by albumin as do the other lipids; 2) are produced in the liver during periods when the amount of acetyl CoA present exceeds the oxidative capacity of the liver; and 3) are used in proportion to their concentration in the blood by extrahepatic tissues, such as skeletal and cardiac muscle, the intestinal mucosa, and the renal cortex. Even the brain can use ketone bodies to help meet its energy needs if the blood levels rise sufficiently. Thus, ketone bodies spare glucose, which is particularly important during prolonged periods of fasting (see p. 332)"
3,"Which amino acid metabolic product can enter the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and form oxaloacetate (OAA), a direct precursor of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP)?",α-ketoglutarate,"or α-ketoglutarate that can enter the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and form oxaloacetate (OAA), a direct precursor of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP)","C. Amino acids

Amino acids produced by hydrolysis of tissue proteins are the major sources of glucose during a fast. Their metabolism generates α-keto acids, such as pyruvate that is converted to glucose, or α-ketoglutarate that can enter the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and form oxaloacetate (OAA), a direct precursor of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP). [Note: Acetyl coenzyme A (CoA) and compounds that give rise only to acetyl CoA (for example, acetoacetate, lysine, and leucine) cannot give rise to a net synthesis of glucose. This is because of the irreversible nature of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHC), which converts pyruvate to acetyl CoA (see p. 109). These compounds give rise instead to ketone bodies (see p.

195) and are termed ketogenic.]

4,What are the two primary products generated during the irreversible oxidative phase of the pentose phosphate pathway?,one pentose sugar-phosphate plus two reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphates (NADPH),"In the oxidative phase, carbon 1 of a glucose 6-phosphate molecule is released as carbon dioxide (CO2), and one pentose sugar-phosphate plus two reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphates (NADPH) are produced.","I. OVERVIEW

The pentose phosphate pathway (or, hexose monophosphate shunt) occurs in the cytosol. It includes an irreversible oxidative phase, followed by a series of reversible sugar–phosphate interconversions (Fig. 13.1). In the oxidative phase, carbon 1 of a glucose 6-phosphate molecule is released as carbon dioxide (CO2), and one pentose sugar-phosphate plus two reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphates (NADPH) are produced. The rate and direction of the reversible reactions are determined by the supply of and demand for intermediates of the pathway. The pentose phosphate pathway provides a major portion of the body’s NADPH, which functions as a biochemical reductant. It also produces ribose 5-phosphate, required for nucleotide biosynthesis (see p. 293), and provides a mechanism for the conversion of pentose sugars to triose and hexose intermediates of glycolysis. No ATP is directly consumed or produced in the pathway.

5,"What type of mutation occurs at codon 6 in the βS gene, leading to sickle cell anemia?","GAG → GTG, glutamate → valine","complementary to the point mutation (GAG → GTG, glutamate → valine) at codon 6 in patients with the βS gene",". 34.11). DNA, isolated from white blood cells (WBC) and amplified, is denatured and applied to a membrane. A radiolabeled oligonucleotide probe, complementary to the point mutation (GAG → GTG, glutamate → valine) at codon 6 in patients with the βS gene, is applied to the membrane. DNA isolated from a heterozygous individual (sickle cell trait) or a homozygous patient (sickle cell anemia) contains a sequence that is complementary to the probe and a double-stranded hybrid form can be detected. In contrast, DNA obtained from normal individuals is not complementary at this position and, therefore, does not form a hybrid (see Fig. 34.11). Use of a pair of such ASO probes (one specific for the normal allele and one specific for the mutant allele) allows all three possible genotypes (homozygous normal, heterozygous, and homozygous mutant) to be distinguished (Fig. 34.12). [Note: ASO probes are useful only if the mutation and its location are known.]"

Bilirubin formation: The first step in the degradation of heme is catalyzed by microsomal heme oxygenase in macrophages of the MPS. In the presence of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate and oxygen, the enzyme catalyzes three successive oxygenations that result in opening of the porphyrin ring (converting cyclic heme to linear biliverdin), production of carbon monoxide (CO), and release of Fe2+ (see Fig. 21.9). [Note: The CO has biologic function, acting as a signaling molecule and anti-inflammatory. Iron is discussed in Chapter 29.] Biliverdin, a green pigment, is reduced, forming the red-orange bilirubin. Bilirubin and its derivatives are collectively termed bile pigments. [Note: The changing colors of a bruise reflect the varying pattern of intermediates that occurs during heme degradation.]"
8,What are the primary ketone bodies synthesized and released by the liver for peripheral tissue fuel?,The primary ketone bodies synthesized and released by the liver are 3-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate.,"The liver is unique in being able to synthesize and release ketone bodies, primarily 3-hydroxybutyrate but also acetoacetate, for use as fuel by peripheral tissues but not by the liver itself because liver lacks thiophorase (see p. 197).","2. Increased ketogenesis: The liver is unique in being able to synthesize and release ketone bodies, primarily 3-hydroxybutyrate but also acetoacetate, for use as fuel by peripheral tissues but not by the liver itself because liver lacks thiophorase (see p. 197). Ketogenesis, which starts during the first days of fasting (Fig. 24.13), is favored when the concentration of acetyl CoA from FA oxidation exceeds the oxidative capacity of the TCA cycle. [Note: Ketogenesis releases CoA, insuring its availability for continued FA oxidation.] The availability of circulating water-soluble ketone bodies is important in fasting because they can be used for fuel by most tissues, including the brain, once their blood level is high enough. Ketone body concentration in blood increases from ~50 µM to ~6 mM in fasting. This reduces the need for gluconeogenesis from amino acid carbon skeletons, thus preserving essential protein (see Fig. 24.11)"
9,What general dietary recommendation exists for monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) as a percentage of caloric intake?,10%–20% of caloric intake,a common recommendation is 10%–20% of caloric intake,"2. Monounsaturated fats: TAG containing primarily fatty acids with one double bond are referred to as monounsaturated fats. Monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) are generally obtained from plant-based oils. When substituted for saturated fatty acids in the diet, MUFA lower both total plasma cholesterol and LDL-C and maintain or increase HDL-C. This ability of MUFA to favorably modify lipoprotein levels may explain, in part, the observation that Mediterranean cultures, with diets rich in olive oil (high in monounsaturated oleic acid), show a low incidence of CHD. [Note: Although there is no AMDR for MUFA, a common recommendation is 10%–20% of caloric intake.] a. The Mediterranean diet: The Mediterranean diet is an example of a diet rich in MUFA (from olive oil) and polyunsaturated fatty acids or PUFA (from fish oils, plant oils, and some nuts) but low in saturated fat.

10,"How is UDP-galactose, the form of galactose needed for lactose synthesis, produced in a nursing female who is on a galactose-free diet?",UDP-glucose is converted to UDP-galactose by UDP-hexose 4-epimerase.,"Uridine diphosphate (UDP)-glucose is converted to UDP-galactose by UDP-hexose 4-epimerase, thereby providing the appropriate form of galactose for lactose synthesis.","Choose the ONE best answer.

2.1. A nursing female with classic galactosemia is on a galactose-free diet. She is able to produce lactose in breast milk because:

A. galactose can be produced from fructose by isomerization.

B. galactose can be produced from a glucose metabolite by epimerization.

C. hexokinase can efficiently phosphorylate galactose to galactose 1phosphate.

D. the enzyme affected in galactosemia is activated by a hormone produced in the mammary gland.

Correct answer = B. Uridine diphosphate (UDP)-glucose is converted to UDPgalactose by UDP-hexose 4-epimerase, thereby providing the appropriate form of galactose for lactose synthesis. Isomerization of fructose to galactose does not occur in the human body. Galactose is not converted to galactose 1phosphate by hexokinase. A galactose-free diet provides no galactose. Galactosemia is the result of an enzyme (galactose 1-phosphate uridylyltransferase) deficiency."
11,What percentage of the world's adults are estimated to be lactose intolerant?,Over 60%,Over 60% of the world’s adults are lactose intolerant,"Lactose intolerance: Over 60% of the world’s adults are lactose intolerant (Fig. 7.11). This is particularly manifested in certain populations. For example, up to 90% of adults of African or Asian descent are lactase deficient. Consequently, they are less able to metabolize lactose than are individuals of Northern European origin. The age-dependent loss of lactase activity starting at approximately age 2 years represents a reduction in the amount of enzyme produced. It is thought to be caused by small variations in the DNA sequence of a region on chromosome 2 that controls expression of the gene for lactase, also on chromosome 2. Treatment for this disorder is to reduce consumption of milk; eat yogurts and some cheeses (bacterial action and aging process decrease lactose content) as well as green vegetables, such as broccoli, to ensure adequate calcium intake; use lactase-treated products; or take lactase in pill form prior to eating"
12,What are the two primary metabolic pathways the liver utilizes to maintain blood glucose levels in the fasted state?,The liver first uses glycogen degradation and then gluconeogenesis.,The liver first uses glycogen degradation and then gluconeogenesis to maintain blood glucose levels to sustain energy metabolism of the brain and other glucose-requiring tissues in the fasted state.,"The liver first uses glycogen degradation and then gluconeogenesis to maintain blood glucose levels to sustain energy metabolism of the brain and other glucose-requiring tissues in the fasted state. [Note: Recall that the presence of glucose-6-phosphatase in the liver allows the production of free glucose both from glycogenolysis and from gluconeogenesis (see Fig. 24.4).] 1. Increased glycogenolysis: Figure 24.11 shows the sources of blood glucose after ingestion of 100 g of glucose. During the brief absorptive period, ingested glucose is the major source of blood glucose. Several hours later, blood glucose levels have declined sufficiently to cause increased secretion of glucagon and decreased secretion of insulin"

It is acquired at birth from the environment and changes with the life stages. The gut microbiome influences host nutrition by facilitating processing of food consumed and is itself influenced by that food. Its relationship with undernutrition, obesity, and diabetes is under investigation.

2.

Children: As with infants, children have increased need for calories and nutrients. The primary concerns in this stage, however, are deficiencies of iron and calcium.

3.

Adolescents: In the teen years, the increases in height and weight increase the need for calories, protein, calcium, iron, and phosphorus. Eating patterns in this stage can result in overconsumption of fat, sodium, and sugar and underconsumption of vitamin A, thiamine, and folic acid.

14,How does calcitriol function to maintain adequate serum calcium levels?,"Calcitriol functions by increasing uptake of Ca2+ by the intestine, minimizing loss of Ca2+ by the kidney by increasing reabsorption, and stimulating resorption of bone when blood Ca2+ is low.","The overall function of calcitriol is to maintain adequate serum levels of Ca2+ . It performs this function by 1) increasing uptake of Ca2+ by the intestine, 2) minimizing loss of Ca2+ by the kidney by increasing reabsorption, and 3) stimulating resorption (demineralization) of bone when blood Ca2+ is low","Hydroxycholecalciferol 1-hydroxylase activity is increased directly by low serum PO43− or indirectly by low serum Ca2+ , which triggers the secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH) from the chief cells of the parathyroid gland. PTH upregulates the 1-hydroxylase. Thus, hypocalcemia caused by insufficient dietary Ca2+ results in elevated levels of serum 1,25-diOH-D3. [Note: 1,25-diOH-D3 inhibits expression of PTH, forming a negative feedback loop. It also inhibits activity of the 1-hydroxylase.]

C. Function

The overall function of calcitriol is to maintain adequate serum levels of Ca2+ . It performs this function by 1) increasing uptake of Ca2+ by the intestine, 2) minimizing loss of Ca2+ by the kidney by increasing reabsorption, and 3) stimulating resorption (demineralization) of bone when blood Ca2+ is low (see Fig. 28.23).

15,What protein acts as a coenzyme for ribonucleotide reductase and provides the reducing equivalents necessary for its regeneration?,Thioredoxin,"The source of the reducing equivalents is thioredoxin, a protein coenzyme of ribonucleotide reductase.","Reduced enzyme regeneration: In order for ribonucleotide reductase to continue to produce deoxyribonucleotides at R1, the disulfide bond created during the production of the 2′-deoxy carbon must be reduced. The source of the reducing equivalents is thioredoxin, a protein coenzyme of ribonucleotide reductase. Thioredoxin contains two cysteine residues separated by two amino acids in the peptide chain. The two –SH groups of thioredoxin donate their hydrogen atoms to ribonucleotide reductase, forming a disulfide bond in the process (Fig. 22.12).

2.

Reduced thioredoxin regeneration: Thioredoxin must be converted back to its reduced form in order to continue performing its function. The reducing equivalents are provided by NADPH + H+, and the reaction is catalyzed by thioredoxin reductase, a selenoprotein (see p. 268).

[Note: These standard amino acids are the only amino acids that are encoded by DNA, the genetic material in the cell (see p. 411). Nonstandard amino acids are produced by chemical modification of standard amino acids (see p. 45).] Each amino acid has a carboxyl group, a primary amino group (except for proline, which has a secondary amino group), and a distinctive side chain (R group) bonded to the α carbon atom. At physiologic pH (~7.4), the carboxyl group is dissociated, forming the negatively charged carboxylate ion (−COO−), and the amino group is protonated (−NH3+) (Fig. 1.1A).

19,"In PCR, what is the approximate temperature required to separate double-stranded DNA into single strands?",~95°C,The target DNA to be amplified is heated to ~95°C to separate the dsDNA into single strands.,"1.

Constructing primer: It is not necessary to know the nucleotide sequence of the target DNA in the PCR method. However, it is necessary to know the nucleotide sequence of short segments on each side of the target DNA. These stretches, called flanking sequences, bracket the DNA sequence of interest. The nucleotide sequences of the flanking regions are used to construct two, single-stranded oligonucleotides, usually 20– 35 nucleotides long, which are complementary to the respective flanking sequences. The 3′-hydroxyl end of each oligonucleotide points toward the target sequence (see Fig. 34.20). These synthetic oligonucleotides function as primers in PCR.

2.

Denaturing DNA: The target DNA to be amplified is heated to ~95°C to separate the dsDNA into single strands.

Nucleoside diphosphates are synthesized from the corresponding nucleoside monophosphates by base-specific nucleoside monophosphate kinases (Fig. 22.9). [Note: These kinases do not discriminate between ribose or deoxyribose in the substrate.] ATP is generally the source of the transferred phosphate because it is present in higher concentrations than the other nucleoside triphosphates. Adenylate kinase is particularly active in the liver and in muscle, where the turnover of energy from ATP is high. Its function is to maintain equilibrium among the adenine nucleotides (AMP, ADP, and ATP). Nucleoside diphosphates and triphosphates are interconverted by nucleoside diphosphate kinase, an enzyme that, unlike the monophosphate kinases, has broad substrate specificity.

21,In which two tissues is lactate predominantly oxidized to pyruvate?,The liver and heart,"For example, in the liver and heart, this ratio is lower than in exercising muscle. Consequently, the liver and heart oxidize lactate (obtained from the blood) to pyruvate.","2.

Lactate utilization: The direction of the LDH reaction depends on the relative intracellular concentrations of pyruvate and lactate and on the ratio of NADH/NAD+. For example, in the liver and heart, this ratio is lower than in exercising muscle. Consequently, the liver and heart oxidize lactate (obtained from the blood) to pyruvate. In the liver, pyruvate is either converted to glucose by gluconeogenesis or converted to acetyl CoA that is oxidized in the TCA cycle. Heart muscle exclusively oxidizes lactate to carbon dioxide and water via the TCA cycle.

CYCLE REGULATION

In contrast to glycolysis, which is regulated primarily by PFK-1, the TCA cycle is controlled by the regulation of several enzymes (see Fig. 9.8). The most important of these regulated enzymes are those that catalyze reactions with highly negative ∆G0: citrate synthase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, and the αketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex. Reducing equivalents needed for oxidative phosphorylation are generated by the PDHC and the TCA cycle, and both processes are upregulated in response to a decrease in the ATP/ADP ratio.

24,"In PCR, DNA polymerase adds nucleotides to which end of the primer?",3′-hydroxyl end,DNA pol adds nucleotides to the 3′-hydroxyl end of the primer,"Extending primers: DNA pol and dNTP (in excess) are added to the mixture (~72°C) to initiate the synthesis of two new strands complementary to the original DNA strands. DNA pol adds nucleotides to the 3′-hydroxyl end of the primer, and strand growth extends in the 5′→3′ direction across the target DNA, making complementary copies of the target. [Note: PCR products can be several thousand base pairs long.] At the completion of one cycle of replication, the reaction mixture is heated again to separate the strands (of which there are now four). Each strand binds a complementary primer, and the step of primer extension is repeated. By using a heat-stable DNA pol (for example, Taq from the bacterium Thermus aquaticus that normally lives at high temperatures), the polymerase is not denatured and, therefore, does not have to be added at each successive cycle. However, Taq lacks proofreading activity"

LDL particles contain much less TAG than their VLDL predecessors and have a high concentration of cholesterol and cholesteryl esters (Fig. 18.19). About 70% of plasma cholesterol is in LDL.

1. Receptor-mediated endocytosis: The primary function of LDL particles is to provide cholesterol to the peripheral tissues (or return it to the liver). They do so by binding to plasma membrane LDL receptors that recognize apo B-100 (but not apo B-48). Because these LDL receptors can also bind apo E, they are known as apo B-100/apo E receptors. A summary of the uptake and degradation of LDL particles is presented in Figure 18.20.

26,What vitamin is required for the conversion of methylmalonyl CoA to succinyl CoA?,Vitamin B12,which is then converted to succinyl CoA (a gluconeogenic precursor) by vitamin B12-requiring methylmalonyl CoA mutase.,". Oxidation of fatty acids with an odd number of carbons proceeds two carbons at a time (producing acetyl CoA) until three-carbon propionyl CoA remains. This compound is carboxylated to methylmalonyl CoA (by biotin-and ATP-requiring propionyl CoA carboxylase), which is then converted to succinyl CoA (a gluconeogenic precursor) by vitamin B12-requiring methylmalonyl CoA mutase. A genetic error in the mutase or vitamin B12 deficiency causes methylmalonic acidemia and aciduria. β-Oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids requires additional enzymes. β-Oxidation of verylong-chain fatty acids and α-oxidation of branched-chain fatty acids occur in the peroxisome. Deficiencies result in X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy and Refsum disease, respectively. ω-Oxidation, normally a minor pathway, occurs in the SER. Liver mitochondria can convert acetyl CoA derived from fatty acid oxidation into acetoacetate and 3-hydroxybutyrate (ketone bodies)"

The acetyl CoA can be oxidized or used in hepatic ketogenesis (see V. below). The reduced coenzymes are oxidized by the electron transport chain, NADH by Complex I, and FADH2 by coenzyme Q (see p. 75). [Note: Acetyl CoA is a positive allosteric effector of pyruvate carboxylase (see p. 119), thus linking fatty acid oxidation and gluconeogenesis.] 4. β-Oxidation energy yield: The energy yield from fatty acid β-oxidation is high. For example, the oxidation of a molecule of palmitoyl CoA to CO2 and H2O produces 8 acetyl CoA, 7 NADH, and 7 FADH2, from which 131 ATP can be generated. However, activation of the fatty acid requires two ATP. Therefore, the net yield from palmitate is 129 ATP (Fig. 16.18). A comparison of the processes of synthesis and degradation of long-chain saturated fatty acids with an even number of carbon atoms is provided in Figure 16.19."

I. OVERVIEW

Virtually all reactions in the body are mediated by enzymes, which are protein catalysts that increase the rate of reactions without being changed in the overall process. Among the many biologic reactions that are energetically possible, enzymes selectively channel reactants (called substrates) into useful pathways. Thus, enzymes direct all metabolic events. This chapter examines the nature of these catalytic molecules and their mechanisms of action.
