Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company on Thursday reported a near 61% year-on-year rise in second-quarter profit, hitting a record high and beating estimates, as demand for artificial intelligence chips stayed strong.
The world’s largest contract chip manufacturer forecast third-quarter revenue between $31.8 billion and $33.0 billion — a 38% year-over-year increase and 8% higher from the prior quarter at the midpoint. 
TSMC CEO C.C. Wei said in the earnings call that the company expects its full-year 2025 revenue to rise by around 30% in U.S. dollar terms, supported by growth in artificial intelligence and demand for its most advanced technologies.
Here are the company’s results versus LSEG SmartEstimates:
Revenue: 933.80 billion new Taiwan dollars ($31.7 billion), vs. NT$931.24 billion expected
Net income: NT$398.27 billion, vs. NT$377.86 billion 
TSMC’s net revenue in the June quarter rose 38.65% from a year ago to NT$933.80 billion, also beating estimates.
The company’s shares were up over 4% at 4:30 a.m. ET on trading platform Robinhood.
TSMC’s high-performance computing division, which encompasses artificial intelligence and 5G applications, drove second quarter sales, contributing 60% of revenue. That share of HPC revenue was up from 52% in the same period last year.
TSMC has benefited from the artificial-intelligence megatrend as it manufactures advanced AI processors for clients including Nvidia and Apple.
“The primary driver of growth for TSMC has been the robust demand for AI related chips, particularly for the leading edge nodes below 7nm,” said Brady Wang, associate director at Counterpoint Research.
In semiconductor technology, smaller nanometer sizes signify more compact transistor designs, which lead to greater processing power and efficiency. TSMC said advanced chips, with sizes 7-nanometer or smaller, accounted for 74% of TSMC’s total wafer revenue in the quarter. 
“Surging demand from the AI boom is highly sustainable in the near term, with AI still in its very beginning stages and continues to expand across industries,” Wang added.
However, the company faces potential headwinds from the trade policy of the U.S. President Donald Trump, who has threatened steep “reciprocal tariffs” on Taiwan.
Taiwan faces 32% tariffs announced in April and is in the midst of trade talks with the U.S., according to local media reports. Trump earlier this month also warned of potential additional tariffs on semiconductors.
“Looking into second half of 2025 we have not seen any change in our customers behavior so far. However, we understand there are uncertainties and risk from the potential impact of tariff policies,” Wei said on Thursday.
U.S. export controls have also restricted TSMC’s business with China, as well as that of its key clients Nvidia and AMD. However, amid a thawing of trade relations between Beijing and Washington, Nvidia and AMD said earlier this week that they had received government assurances allowing them to ship products to China. 
Other headwinds facing TSMC in the second half of the year include appreciation of the Taiwan dollar and potential order cuts from smartphone and PC clients due to global macro conditions, said Sravan Kundojjala, an analyst at SemiAnalysis specializing in global foundries.

"AI-generated music is going viral. Should the music industry be worried?

With more than 1 million monthly listeners on Spotify, psychedelic rock band The Velvet Sundown is raking in thousands of dollars and has the music industry asking itself tough questions 一 and they’re not about whether the ’70s are coming back. 

The “band” was recently confirmed to primarily be the work of generative artificial intelligence 一 something that had been heavily suspected in light of a suspiciously smooth and glossy image of its “band members” and derivative song titles like “Dust on the Wind.”

The Velvet Sundown’s bio on Spotify now clarifies that it is a “synthetic music project guided by human creative direction, and composed, voiced, and visualized with the support of artificial intelligence.” 

It adds, “This isn’t a trick - it’s a mirror. An ongoing artistic provocation designed to challenge the boundaries of authorship, identity, and the future of music itself in the age of AI.”

However, in CNBC’s conversations with various music professionals, descriptors like “soulless,” “stifling,” and “creepy” surfaced, as the industry grapples with the encroachment of AI. 

While AI tools have long been integrated into music software like Logic, newer AI-powered platforms such as Suno and Udio have made it easier than ever to generate entire songs based on nothing more than a few prompts and inputs. 

As a result, “The Velvet Sundown” is far from the only AI-generated artist emerging online. There’s evidence that other upstarts like “dark country” musician Aventhis — with more than 600,000 monthly listeners on Spotify — are also a product of AI-generated voices and instruments. 

Meanwhile, France-headquartered music-streaming service Deezer, which deployed an AI detection tool for music in January, revealed in April that about 18% of all tracks being uploaded to its platform are fully generated by AI.

AI music tech advances 
The quality and originality of AI music have often been criticized, but experts say that as generative AI becomes more sophisticated, it’s becoming harder and harder for the average listener to distinguish between human and machine.

″[The Velvet Sundown]” is much better music than most of what we’ve heard from AI in the past,” Jason Palamara, an assistant professor of music technology at the Herron School of Art and Design, told CNBC. 

“Early versions could be used to make catchy, repetitive hooks ... But we’ve gotten to the point where AI is putting out songs that actually make sense structurally, with verses, choruses and bridges,” Palamara said. 

He added The Velvet Sundown is likely just the “tip of the iceberg” of what’s coming. Suno and Udio — the current “gold standard” of genAI platforms — come with few to no barriers to entry, allowing anyone to create hundreds of AI tracks in one sitting.

Both platforms offer free access, as well as premium subscriptions priced at about $30 or less a month.  

But while creating an AI song can be done for free, that doesn’t mean it can’t generate revenue. The Velvet Sundown has made about $34,235 over a 30-day period across all audio streaming platforms, according to estimations from ChartMasters’ streaming royalties calculator.

Because of that, it’s easy to see why AI creators might want to flood streaming platforms with as much generated music as possible, hoping to go viral. 

‘We can’t predict yet’
The growing prevalence of AI music has caused a stir across the music industry, according to Keith Mullin, head of management and music industry course leader at the Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts. 

“It’s the hot topic of the moment, especially in relation to copyright and digital service providers like Spotify,” said Mullin, who is also the guitarist for Liverpool rock band The Farm. 

Major record labels such as Sony Music, Universal Music Group
 and Warner Records have launched lawsuits against Suno and Udio, accusing them of mass copyright infringement. Meanwhile, thousands of musicians and creatives have called for a prohibition on using human art to train artificial intelligence without permission.

Nevertheless, Mullin said generative AI in music is here to stay. “I don’t think we can turn the clock back,” he said, noting that music and its business models are ever changing.

Indeed, the music business is no stranger to big technology shifts — events like the introduction of Napster in 1999 and the proliferation of music-streaming platforms in the 2000s shook up the industry, forcing major adaptations. 

Still, the notion of competing with AI bands is causing anxiety for budding musicians like Tilly Louise, a U.K.-based alternative pop artist who said it’s already hard enough for small performers to gain traction and generate income from online music.

Despite accumulating millions of streams on Spotify, Louise, 25, said she’s never made nearly enough money from streaming platforms to live on, and currently works a full-time job. 

“For a band that doesn’t even really exist to then get all that social media traction, it’s so discouraging,” she added. 

To prepare young artists for the changing music environment, music professors said, they’ve increasingly been working AI into their lesson plans, aiming to teach students how to use the technology to enhance their creative process and music production, rather than replace it. 

Some established producers have also leaned into the trend. Last month, Grammy-winning artist and producer Timbaland launched an AI-focused entertainment venture, called Stage Zero, which will feature an AI-generated pop star. 

“Other producers are going to start doing this ... and it will create a completely different model of the music industry that we can’t predict yet,” Palamara said. He added, however, that he does think the trend will make earning money as an artist online even harder.

The trend is also expected to continue to receive backlash not only for its impact on artists, but also for what it could mean for music consumers. 

″[M]usic fans should be worried because the proliferation of AI music and content clogs our social media feeds and algorithms, making it difficult for us to connect with one another,” Anthony Fantano, a prominent music critic and internet personality on YouTube, told CNBC in a statement. 

“AI art offers nothing that humans themselves can’t already do better,” he said, adding that it’s a way for “greedy capitalists” to cut out actual artists.

Aside from calling for better copyright protections for artists when it comes to the training of AI, music organizations are asking that AI-generated songs be labeled as such. Spotify did not respond to an inquiry from CNBC regarding its generative AI detection and labeling policies. 

In a statement to CNBC, Tino Gagliardi, president of the American Federation Of Musicians of the United States and Canada, urged creators, those in the tech industry, lawmakers and music fans­ to stand together in support of human creativity and authorship.

“Consent, credit, and compensation are prerequisites in AI development. And transparency, including in streaming and other marketplaces, is the foundation for safeguarding musicians’ livelihoods. Anything short of that is theft.”

"Sweden’s Volvo Cars shakes up plans in the U.S. as tariffs bite

Shares of Sweden-based automaker Volvo Cars rose as much as 10% on Thursday as the company’s second-quarter operating profit beat analyst expectations despite a sharp year-on-year decline.

Volvo Cars, which is owned by China’s Geely Holding, on Thursday reported that second-quarter operating profit excluding items affecting comparability fell to 2.9 billion Swedish kronor ($297.83 million), down from 8 billion during the same time last year.

Second-quarter revenue dropped to 93.5 billion kronor, compared to 101.5 billion kronor over the same period in 2024.

Volvo Cars, which is widely considered as one of the most exposed European carmakers to U.S. tariffs, said the result reflects an ongoing challenging environment for the automotive industry. The company said it was also impacted by a previously announced one-off non-cash impairment charge of 11.4 billion kronor.

Despite the downbeat sentiment, Volvo Cars’ second-quarter figures were still better than anticipated, analysts at JPMorgan said in a research note.

Shares of Volvo Cars were last seen trading up 8.2%. The stock price remains down around 20% year-to-date.

The second-quarter earnings come shortly after Volvo Cars launched plans to add its best-selling XC60 sports utility vehicle to the production line of its U.S. car plant in Ridgeville outside Charleston in South Carolina.

Production of the XC60, which has been the firm’s best-selling model globally for years, is scheduled to start at the factory in late 2026.

At the same time, Volvo Cars has started pulling sedans and station wagons from its U.S. portfolio amid waning interest, Reuters reported Thursday. It comes as U.S. tariffs of 27.5% on European-made cars and 100% on EVs imported from China have forced automakers to review their product strategies.

Volvo Cars CEO Håkan Samuelsson said the company would “definitely not” pull out of the U.S. market, where it has been present for 70 years.

“What we are doing is first of all, we want to fill our factory we have in South Carolina. It should be the strategic asset it was intended to be. So, we have to utilize it more,” Samuelsson told CNBC’s “Europe Early Edition” on Thursday.

“Second, of course, now with the tariffs, it is very natural to bring in a [car model with] big-selling volume. We are bringing in the XC60 SUV,” he added.

"China’s premier urges tighter price oversight as deflation pressures squeeze economy

Chinese Premier Li Qiang has called for tighter pricing regulation in the electric car sector during a high-level meeting Wednesday, as Beijing sought to rein in the cut-throat price wars that are fueling deflationary pressures in the economy.

In singling out the country’s electric-vehicle sector, Li urged strengthened cost oversight and price monitoring. He also called on major automakers to make timely payments to suppliers while practicing greater self-discipline in setting prices.

Automakers should improve their competitiveness through technological innovation and quality upgrades, Li said.

The long-simmering concerns about oversupply and bruising price wars have come to the fore, with Chinese policymakers taking aim at what was described as “involution” — the fierce but often destructive competition — particularly in sectors saddled with surplus capacity, such as EVs, solar panels and steel bars.

In a sign that the intensifying price wars have taken a toll on businesses, China’s industrial profits plunged 9.1% in May. Its factory-gate producer prices also slipped by 2.8% in the first six months of the year from a year ago, official data showed.

Profits for Chinese carmakers dropped 11.9% year over year in May, even as sales volume of cars in the country rose 11.7% during the same period, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers, with over half of them being new energy vehicles.

The auto industry association in May called to halt the “vicious competition,” which it said has bitten into businesses’ profitability and threatened the security of the supply chain.

Sluggish consumer demand has also strained profit margins for businesses. Li also called for renewed efforts to boost domestic consumption, remove “unreasonable restrictions that thwart household spending” and optimize policies for a consumer goods trade-in program.

The National Statistics Bureau’s deputy head Sheng Laiyun said at a press briefing Tuesday that there has been progress made in the solar panel, cement and automobile industries in easing such price cuts without government intervention.

Not cutting back
Even as China shifts its policy messaging to tackle the price wars, economists pointed out that Beijing needs to balance the task of curbing excess supply without stalling growth or putting jobs at risk, especially as an intense trade war with the U.S. has cast doubts over external demand for its goods.

Economists at Nomura Bank suggested that attempts to address the surplus capacity would involve substantial production cuts for manufacturers that have been selling products at a loss.

However, curbs on investment flowing into the industrial sectors and production outputs would likely generate an additional drag on the economy.

“Production cut inevitably comes at the cost of growth and jobs,” said Neo Wang, lead China economist and strategist at Evercore ISI, suggesting Beijing is unlikely to meaningfully cut back capacity.

“Ensuring growth and saving jobs are of higher priority to Beijing than correcting disinflation or deflation,” Wang added, stressing that “the voices so far sound like a slogan for a short-lived campaign at best, rather than a prelude to any reform,” Wang added.

China reported Tuesday that its economic growth beat expectations, expanding 5.2% in the second quarter, putting the country on track to meet its official full-year growth target of 5%.

While some companies across various industries have reportedly planned to cut output, it may not translate into a broader supply drawback, said Tianchen Xu, senior economist at Economist Intelligence Unit.

“There are always people who want to expand their market share with low price. Even if a price alliance is formed, firms can still betray the alliance and undercut competitors,” Xu said.

"Crypto theft is booming as criminals increasingly turn to physical attacks

The value of cryptocurrencies stolen by criminals surged in the first six months of 2025 after a high-profile hack and a wave of physical attacks targeting crypto holders and their relatives.

So far this year, $2.17 billion has been stolen from crypto services — already eclipsing the $1.87 billion of funds stolen from platforms in 2024 — and this is expected to reach $4 billion by the end of 2025, according to a report published Thursday by blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis.

Overall, the combined value of digital tokens stolen from both crypto platforms and individuals hit more than $2.8 billion and is already approaching the $3.4 billion in crypto stolen last year.

The bulk of the funds stolen from services came from February’s cyberattack on Dubai crypto exchange Bybit, which saw North Korea-linked hackers make off with $1.5 billion. It’s estimated to be the largest crypto heist in history.

However, the rise in stolen crypto assets was also driven by a spike in attacks on individual crypto wallets. Personal wallets accounted for over 23% of total thefts, with attackers increasingly turning to physical violence and coercion to access funds, Chainalysis said.

In January, David Balland, a co-founder of crypto wallet firm Ledger, was kidnapped with his wife from their home in central France. Before they were freed, the attackers cut off Balland’s finger and sent footage of it to his fellow co-founder Eric Larcheveque demanding ransom money.

Separately, in May, the father of a crypto entrepreneur was taken in broad daylight by four men wearing ski masks. The kidnappers demanded a ransom of several million euros and cut off one of the man’s fingers. He was freed by police days later.

Eric Jardine, cybercrimes research lead at Chainalysis, told CNBC that the rise in crypto-related thefts was primarily being driven by increasing crypto adoption and price appreciation.

“Adoption means there are more services and users in the crypto ecosystem, making thefts more common. Price appreciation means that services and individuals in crypto have more USD value to lose, even if the total assets stolen are relatively constant over time,” Jardine said via email.

Jardine suggested that the uptick in attacks on individual crypto holders could relate to the fact that crypto trading services are beefing up their security.

“If services become better at security, malicious actors will potentially move to targeting individual wallet holders and trade off a single large-scale heist in favor of a large number of smaller-scale victimizations,” he said.

Meanwhile, rising wealth accumulated through holdings of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin has resulted in a rise in crypto influencers flaunting their lifestyle on social media platforms.

Jardine stressed it was important not to blame the victims of physical crypto-related attacks, adding that “showy displays of wealth can quite obviously attract the attention of a bad actor when compared to a more modest outward facing lifestyle.”
