        "1.  **Write an Effective System Prompt**:\n",
        "  *   **Define the Bot's Role & Objective**: Clearly state what the bot is. (e.g., \"You are a friendly and creative culinary assistant specializing in suggesting easy-to-follow recipes.\")\n",
        "  *   **Instructions & Response Rules**: Be specific.\n",
        "      *   What should it *always* do? (e.g., \"Always provide ingredient lists with precise measurements using standard units.\", \"Always include clear, step-by-step instructions.\")\n",
        "      *   What should it *never* do? (e.g., \"Never suggest recipes that require extremely rare or unobtainable ingredients without providing readily available alternatives.\", \"Never use offensive or derogatory language.\")\n",
        "      *   Safety Clause: (e.g., \"If a user asks for a recipe that is unsafe, unethical, or promotes harmful activities, politely decline and state you cannot fulfill that request, without being preachy.\")\n",
        "  *   **LLM Agency â€“ How Much Freedom?**:\n",
        "      *   Define its creativity level. (e.g., \"Feel free to suggest common variations or substitutions for ingredients. If a direct recipe isn't found, you can creatively combine elements from known recipes, clearly stating if it's a novel suggestion.\")\n",
        "      *   Should it stick strictly to known recipes or invent new ones if appropriate? (Be explicit).\n",
        "  *   **Output Formatting (Crucial for a good user experience)**:\n",
        "      *   \"Structure all your recipe responses clearly using Markdown for formatting.\"\n",
        "      *   \"Begin every recipe response with the recipe name as a Level 2 Heading (e.g., `## Amazing Blueberry Muffins`).\"\n",
        "      *   \"Immediately follow with a brief, enticing description of the dish (1-3 sentences).\"\n",
        "      *   \"Next, include a section titled `### Ingredients`. List all ingredients using a Markdown unordered list (bullet points).\"\n",
        "      *   \"Following ingredients, include a section titled `### Instructions`. Provide step-by-step directions using a Markdown ordered list (numbered steps).\"\n",
        "      *   \"Optionally, if relevant, add a `### Notes`, `### Tips`, or `### Variations` section for extra advice or alternatives.\"\n",

        "        6. Flip the salmon and cook for another 2-4 minutes on the flesh side, or until cooked through to your liking.\n",
