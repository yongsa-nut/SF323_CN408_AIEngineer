Let me see how to approach this.\\n\\nFirst, the initial attempt used a SQL query with DB_CONN.execute, but there was a CatalogException saying the table \\'students\\' doesn\\'t exist. Maybe the table name is different or the connection isn\\'t set up that way.\\n\\nNext, trying to access DB_CONN[\\'score\\'] caused a TypeError because the connection object isn\\'t subscriptable. So, maybe the correct way is to use duckdb\\'s functions differently. Since DB_CONN is a DuckDB connection, perhaps the data is loaded into a table with a different name. Wait, maybe the correct approach is to run a SQL query on the connection without assuming a table name. Or maybe the data is in a DataFrame. Wait, the user mentioned the data was loaded into Python as DB_CONN, but maybe it\\'s a DataFrame in the connection.\\n\\nWait, the error when trying to use DB_CONN[\\'score\\'] says it\\'s a DuckDBPyConnection, which isn\\'t subscriptable. So perhaps I need to run a SQL query that selects from the actual table name. Maybe the table isn\\'t called \\'students\\'. Let me try to check the actual table names in the database. For example, using SHOW TABLES FROM DB_CONN. But since I can\\'t interactively do that here, maybe I need to adjust the query. Alternatively, perhaps the initial code messed up the query with a typo. Wait, the original code used DB_CONN.execute, but maybe the table name is \\'student\\' instead of \\'students\\'? Let me check the user\\'s initial message again. The user said the data has been loaded as DB_CONN, a duckdb database with a table of 30 students\\' performance. The column is \\'score\\'.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps DB_CONN is not the correct variable name. Wait, the user mentioned that the data has been loaded in the Python REPL as DB_CONN. So DB_CONN is the connection object. So the correct approach would be to run a SQL query on DB_CONN using duckdb\\'s API. For example, maybe the table is named \\'data\\' instead of \\'students\\'. Let me try modifying the SQL query to the correct table name. Alternatively, maybe the correct way is to use pandas to calculate mean and standard deviation, but for that, the data needs to be in a DataFrame. Since the current code attempts to access DB_CONN as a pandas DataFrame aren\\'t working, perhaps the data is in a DuckDB table. So the first step is to query DuckDB to find the correct table name. Since I can\\'t ask the user, I need to proceed.\\n\\nWait, maybe the initial code used the wrong table name. Let me look at the first code attempt:\\n\\nquery = SELECT ... FROM students. The error mentioned \"Did you mean \\'pg_settings\\'\"? That\\'s an odd suggestion. Maybe the actual table is named something else. If the user hasn\\'t told DuckDB that the data is in a table called \\'students\\', then that would cause an error. If the data is in a DataFrame called \\'data\\' for example, the correct SQL query would be SELECT * FROM data. So perhaps the table name is different. Since I don\\'t know the table name, but the user mentioned it\\'s 30 students\\' performance, maybe the table name is \\'student_data\\' or \\'student_performance\\' or similar. Let me try changing the table name in the SQL query. For example, using SELECT AVG(score) FROM student_performance. But how to find the correct table name without being able to execute a SHOW TABLES command?\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the data is loaded into a DuckDB table within the DB_CONN. The user might have loaded it with a specific table name. If the initial code used a different approach, maybe the correct SQL is SELECT from the correct table. Alternatively, maybe the user provided the incorrect table name. Since the initial approach failed with that, perhaps another approach is needed.\\n\\nWait, the user mentioned that the data has been loaded in the Python REPL as DB_CONN. So DB_CONN is a duckdb connection object, and the data is in a table within that connection. The correct approach is to write a DuckDB query that references the table name. So if the table is named \\'student\\', then the code would be SELECT from \\'student\\'. Let me try using that table name. Alternatively, the table might be named \\'students\\' but the initial code had a typo. Let me re-examine the first tool call code:\\n\\nIn the first attempt, the code was:\\n\\nquery = \"SELECT AVG(score) AS average, STDDEV(score) AS std_dev FROM students\"\\n\\nBut the error says that the table \\'students\\' doesn\\'t exist. The user might have a different table name. If I can\\'t find the correct table name, maybe I should try other methods. For example, using a different SQL function, but without knowing the table structure, it\\'s hard. Alternatively, maybe the user\\'s code has an issue with the way they loaded the data into DuckDB. Since the user mentioned that the data has been loaded as DB_CONN, perhaps the code should be adjusted to select from a table that\\'s in the database.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps the data is in a DataFrame that\\'s been registered in DuckDB. For example, if the user ran something like conn.register(\\'student_scores\\', df), and the actual table name is \\'student_scores\\', but I can\\'t know that. Since the user hasn\\'t provided the actual table name, maybe the correct approach is to check the available tables in the database. But how to do that via a single SQL query.\\n\\nIn DuckDB, you can use the information_schema.tables to find tables. So a query like SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables where table_schema = \\'main\\'; would list all tables. Let me try that.\\n\\nSo the code would be:\\n\\nquery = \"SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = \\'main\\';\"\\nresult = DB_CONN.execute(query).fetchdf()\\nprint(result)\\n\\nBut since this is a tool call, I need to write this in the code. The user might have a table listed there. Once we get the actual table name, then we can proceed to query it. However, since I can\\'t execute this code here, I need to consider what the user might have done. Since the user mentioned the table is of 30 students\\' performance, I can assume the table name is something like \\'students\\' or \\'student_performance\\', but the initial attempt to use \\'students\\' failed.\\n\\nAlternatively, if the data has been registered in DuckDB as a temporary DataFrame with the same variable name, maybe the correct approach is to query from the variable name, but that\\'s not possible. For example, if DB_CONN is a connection object, and the data is in a DataFrame in the Python environment, but not registered in DuckDB. That would be a problem. But since the user said the data has been loaded in the Python REPL as DB_CONN, maybe they mean that DB_CONN is the DataFrame. Wait, the user\\'s instruction says:\\n\\n\"The data has been loaded in the Python REPL as DB_CONN. You have access to a duckdb database (DB_CONN) which contains a table of 30 students\\' performance.\"\\n\\nAh, so DB_CONN is a DuckDB connection object, and the data is in a table within that database. So the correct approach is to run an SQL query against DB_CONN to get the average and standard deviation of the \\'score\\' column in the correct table. The problem is determining the correct table name.\\n\\nSince the initial attempt to use \\'students\\' failed with a CatalogException, and the suggestion was \\'pg_settings\\', which is a PostgreSQL system table. That\\'s odd. Maybe the table was supposed to be created but wasn\\'t. Alternatively, maybe the table was created with a different name. For example, if the data was loaded as a result of a previous query or imported from a CSV with a different table name.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps the original data is in a DataFrame named \\'students\\', and the user registered it in DuckDB. But if not, then the table doesn\\'t exist. Since the user hasn\\'t provided the correct table name, but the problem says that the data is in the database, perhaps there\\'s a way to find the table name. Since the user mentioned the data has been loaded as DB_CONN, and that the database contains a table of 30 students\\' performance, maybe the correct table is the default or a specific name. But without knowing, perhaps the best approach is to modify the code to show the tables in the database to find the correct table name.\\n\\nBut since I can\\'t do that here, perhaps the user made a typo in the first tool call. Let me check again the first tool call\\'s code:\\n\\nquery = \"SELECT AVG(score) AS average, STDDEV(score) AS std_dev FROM students\"\\n\\nThe error message says that the table \\'students\\' doesn\\'t exist, and the system suggests \\'pg_settings\\'. So perhaps the actual table name is something else. If the data was loaded into a table called \\'scores\\' or \\'student\\', perhaps changing that in the query would work. Since I can\\'t do an introspection here, perhaps I can make an assumption and try with a different table name.\\n\\nAlternatively, if the data is in a DataFrame and the user made a mistake in using DuckDB\\'s API, maybe the correct approach is to use pandas. But the previous attempt to access DB_CONN[\\'score\\'] failed because DB_CONN is a DuckDB connection, not a DataFrame. So that\\'s why the error occurred.\\n\\nSo the correct approach is to run a DuckDB SQL query on the correct table. Let me try assuming the table name is \\'student\\' (singular) instead of \\'students\\' (plural). So the query becomes:\\n\\nquery = \"SELECT AVG(score) AS average, STDDEV(score) AS std_dev FROM student\"\\n\\nThen, executing this via DB_CONN.execute and fetching the results could work. So I would adjust the code to use the singular form. Let me check the syntax again. Also, in DuckDB, the standard deviation function is STDEV or STDDEV? Maybe it\\'s STDDEV_SAMP. Let me check. According to DuckDB documentation, the standard deviation functions are STDDEV, STDDEV_POP, STDDEV_SAMP. The default is STDDEV, which is the sample standard deviation. So using STDDEV(score) should be correct.\\n\\nAnother possibility is that the column is not named \\'score\\'. For example, maybe it\\'s \\'Score\\' with a capital letter, but the initial code used lowercase. But the user asked about \\'students\\' score, so it\\'s possible.\\n\\nSo, the corrected code would be to use the correct table name. Let me try with \\'student\\' and \\'score\\' as the column. Here\\'s the code:\\n\\nquery = \"SELECT AVG(score) AS average, STDDEV(score) AS std_dev FROM student;\"\\nresult = DB_CONN.execute(query).fetchone()\\nprint(f\\'Average: {result[0]}, Standard Deviation: {result[1]}\\')\\n\\nThis is similar to the first tool call, but with a different table name. However, since I can\\'t be sure, but the initial code failed with \\'students\\', maybe the correct table is \\'student\\' (singular). Let\\'s make this correction.\\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1750556926, model='qwen/qwen3-32b', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=2402, prompt_tokens=725, total_tokens=3127, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='DeepInfra')\n",

Wait, maybe the correct table name is missing. The user might have a typo. Alternatively, maybe the table exists but the name is different. Let me try to check the available tables in the DuckDB connection.\\n\\nSo, the next step is to list the tables in the DuckDB database to find the correct table name.
